    abstract = {Feature selection plays a critical role in biomedical data mining, driven by increasing feature dimensionality in target problems and growing interest in advanced but computationally expensive methodologies able to model complex associations. Specifically, there is a need for feature selection methods that are computationally efficient, yet sensitive to complex patterns of association, e.g. interactions, so that informative features are not mistakenly eliminated prior to downstream modeling. This paper focuses on Relief-based algorithms ({RBAs}), a unique family of filter-style feature selection algorithms that have gained appeal by striking an effective balance between these objectives while flexibly adapting to various data characteristics, e.g. classification vs. regression. First, this work broadly examines types of feature selection and defines {RBAs} within that context. Next, we introduce the original Relief algorithm and associated concepts, emphasizing the intuition behind how it works, how feature weights generated by the algorithm can be interpreted, and why it is sensitive to feature interactions without evaluating combinations of features. Lastly, we include an expansive review of {RBA} methodological research beyond Relief and its popular descendant, {ReliefF}. In particular, we characterize branches of {RBA} research, and provide comparative summaries of {RBA} algorithms including contributions, strategies, functionality, time complexity, adaptation to key data characteristics, and software availability.},

The proposed model structure adaptation method starts with the first-principles model of the system and adapts its structure after adjusting its individual components in symbolic form. A key contribution of this work is its introduction of the model's parameter sensitivity as the measure of symbolic changes to the model. This measure, which is essential to defining the structural sensitivity of the model, not only accommodates algebraic evaluation of candidate models in lieu of more computationally expensive simulation-based evaluation, but also makes possible the implementation of gradient-based optimisation in symbolic adaptation. The proposed method is applied to models of several virtual and real-world systems that demonstrate its potential utility.},

    abstract = {Modern industrial-scale wind turbines are nonlinear systems that operate in turbulent environments. As such, it is difficult to characterize their behavior accurately across a wide range of operating conditions using physically meaningful models. Customarily, the models derived from wind turbine data are in ‘black box’ format, lacking in both conciseness and intelligibility. To address these deficiencies, we use a recently developed symbolic regression method to identify models of a modern horizontal-axis wind turbine in symbolic form. The method uses evolutionary multiobjective optimization to produce succinct dynamic models from operational data while making minimal assumptions about the physical properties of the system. We compare the models produced by this method to models derived by other methods according to their estimation capacity and evaluate the trade-off between model intelligibility and accuracy. Several succinct models are found that predict wind turbine behavior as well as or better than more complex alternatives derived by other methods. We interpret the new models to show that they often contain intelligible estimates of real process physics.},

    abstract = {An analytical formulation was developed to estimate the load-sharing and planetary loads of a three-point suspension wind turbine drivetrain considering the effects of non-torque loads, gravity and bearing clearance. A three-dimensional dynamic drivetrain model that includes mesh stiffness variation, tooth modifications and gearbox housing flexibility was also established to investigate gear tooth load distribution and non-linear tooth and bearing contact of the planetary gears. These models were validated with experimental data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Gearbox Reliability Collaborative. Non-torque loads and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating carrier frame, which can increase gearbox loads and disturb load sharing. Clearance in the carrier bearings reduces the bearing stiffness significantly. This increases the amount of pitching moment transmitted from the rotor to the gear meshes and disturbs the planetary load share, thereby resulting in edge loading. Edge loading increases the likelihood of tooth pitting and planet-bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life. Additionally, at low-input torque, the planet-bearing loads are often less than the minimum recommended load and thus susceptible to skidding. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Towards this goal, we investigate the use of machine learning as a way to bias which components of programs are promoted, and propose two semantic operators to choose where useful building blocks are placed during crossover. A forward stagewise crossover operator we propose leads to significant improvements on a set of regression problems, and produces state-of-the-art results in a large benchmark study. We discuss this architecture and others in terms of their propensity for allowing heuristic search to utilize information during the evolutionary process. Finally, we look at the collinearity and complexity of the data representations that result from these architectures, with a view towards disentangling factors of variation in application.},

    title = {Genetic Programming Representations for Multi-dimensional Feature Learning in Biomedical Classification},
    isbn = {978-3-319-55849-3},
    abstract = {We present a new classification method that uses genetic programming ({GP}) to evolve feature transformations for a deterministic, distanced-based classifier. This method, called M4GP, differs from common approaches to classifier representation in {GP} in that it does not enforce arbitrary decision boundaries and it allows individuals to produce multiple outputs via a stack-based {GP} system. In comparison to typical methods of classification, M4GP can be advantageous in its ability to produce readable models. We conduct a comprehensive study of M4GP, first in comparison to other {GP} classifiers, and then in comparison to six common machine learning classifiers. We conduct full hyper-parameter optimization for all of the methods on a suite of 16 biomedical data sets, ranging in size and difficulty. The results indicate that M4GP outperforms other {GP} methods for classification. M4GP performs competitively with other machine learning methods in terms of the accuracy of the produced models for most problems. M4GP also exhibits the ability to detect epistatic interactions better than the other methods.},

Selection methods are an important part of evolutionary algorithms since they determine which
candidate solutions are kept around during search. Recently I developed a variant of lexicase
selection known as epsilon-lexicase selection to work with regression problems.

In a recent paper we delve more into the theory behind why lexicase works, looking both at
probabilities of selection and multi-objective interpretations of this method. Check it out on
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05394).

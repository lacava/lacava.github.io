**Note**: we are no longer making pizzas :)

Nellie and I are making ~50 pizzas for the next month to help raise money for COVID-19 relief and also to, well, eat good pizza during this strange time. 
All pizzas are getting made at lunch-time on weekdays. 

# How it works

- Pick a pie. Limit two per person. 
- Pick a day and time to pick up at our house. If you *need* delivery (within a mile of our house), give us your address.
- Venmo me [@William-LaCava](https://venmo.com/William-LaCava). 100% of the money we collect goes straight to COVID-19 relief in Philly.
    - $10 - you're kinda broke or outa work and want some good pizza
    - $15 - sweet spot
    - $20+ - you are thriving and want to spread world pizza!!

Want to donate a pie to someone? Cool! Fill them in, or just say it's anonymous and we'll figure out who needs one.

# About the Pizza

Each pizza is around 14", rarely a circle but close. 
I use an 84% hydrated dough to make pizza starting with a *biga*, a stiff starter. 
The dough is cold-fermented for 12-20 hours.

I cook them with a combination of pizza stone and broiler to get a charred finish. 
Generally I'm going for something between Neapolitan style and my dad/grandpa/grandma's style.

The crust should be airy, crackly, and chewy. 
Not a new york slice.

Special thanks to Angelo Spagnolo who gave me my first biga and [Jim Lahey's pizza recipe](https://www.sullivanstreetbakery.com/jim),
and to Ricardo Ortiz who convinced me to fold my dough.

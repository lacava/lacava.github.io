Just got back from key west and I have three recent publications to share. One is a journal paper
where we apply the model structure adaptation method to nonlinear control design. It is [out
now](https://dynamicsystems.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleID=2601296) in
the ASME journal of dynamic systems, measurement and control. I'm also excited to share that i'll be
presenting two papers at evostar this year, [one](/pubs/evostar_few_lacava.pdf) in the eurogp track 
and [one](/pubs/evobio_m4gp_lacava.pdf) in evoapps. Check out the preprints on my [work](/research/) page.

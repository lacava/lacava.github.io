I run the [Cava Lab](https://cavalab.org). 
We work to make AI technology deployed in health systems more fair, interpretable, and accessible. 
If you're looking to do a post-doc, graduate or undergraduate studies about interpretability, fairness, ML and health informatics, [see here](https://cavalab.org/join).
